          Javascript, HTML and CSS could be compared to a musical. HTML is the
          core of the musical handling things like the stage and instruments.
          CSS is like the whole design and the way eveything should be layed out
          on stage. Finally Javascript is the people who play the insturments
          and dancers addinng interaction with the audience. To be engaging with
          the public you need all three.

          Best way i could describe control flow and loops is to a making a cup
          of tea. The descision making such as boiling the water, what tea
          you're going to have, will it have sugar or milk. This descision
          making process is the control flow where you follow steps in a speciic
          order based on conditions
        </li>
        <li>
          Loops on the other hand can be compared to things you repeat during
          the making of the tea. Things like stirring the milk in until it looks
          a certain way or until the sugar has disolved. The action of stirring
          until something has happened is the loop.

        The DOM is used to access the document and its elements using
        JavaScript. Without the DOM, Javascript wouldn't have any notion on what
        is going on in the webpage. The DOM is not apart of the Javascript
        language but is instead a web API used to build websites. The Dom was
        designed to be independent of any particular programming language making
        the structural representation of the document available from a single,
        consistent API.

      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/CodeExample.jpeg"
          alt="Code example"
          style="height: 450px; width: 500px"
        />

        So in this example that i found we can see an HTML file with CSS styling
        included and at the bottom JavaScript. The file contains a button and
        colored box, the box changes color when the button has been selected.
        The JavaScript tells the button to listen for the click and once clicked
        it will change the color. The DOM uses ths to interact with the elements
        on the page.

    <div>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/ObjectVsArray.jpeg"
          alt="Ojects and Arrays"
          style="height: 450px; width: 500px"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Arrays</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Arrays are numbered list of items that you can access</li>
        <li>For example the first, second and third item on the list</li>
        <li>With Arras you use numbers to find items</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Objects</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Objects are like labeled boxes</li>
        <li>You can access the box using each of the labels</li>
        <li>So with Objects you use labels to find properties</li>
      </p>

        <img

          alt="Functions Example"
          style="height: 450px; width: 500px"
        />
      </p>

        Functions are like a set of instructions that you are able to use over
        and over again, this helps you not repeat the same code over and over
        again. This makes coding a lot easier to manage and keeps your code
        tidy. Using functions helps you save time by reusing the same set of
        instructions.
