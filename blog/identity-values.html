          We had been having after work drinks at the pub, we had been there for
          a while and one of my mates was a hell of a lot drunker than the rest
          of my mates. A lot of my friends wanted to keep going even though he
          was plastered. Either I could let him go with everyone and get into a
          worse state and end up wherever or I could drive him home (I was sober
          D that night). I did think that I could tag a long and look after him
          but then that would put me in an annoying position having to pick him
          up and carry him. I decided to take him home, the guys ended up
          agreeing he should go home. I did end up crashing on his couch cause
          he couldn't keep anything down. I just think that it was the right
          thing to do and I did think a lot about whether or not I wanted to be
          killjoy or put my mate first. I know that a few times mates have done
          the same for me so, helping them out when they've gone a little
          overboard is the right thing to do.

          I was always raised to do the right thing and to make sure you treat
          people the right way. The people I surround myself with are very much
          the same, a lot of my friends are like family to me and vice versa. I
          think from the get go I surrounded myself with these kind of people,
          this moulded me into a caring and loving person. I help my friends and
          they help me through anything.

          According to that strengths finder I'm a caring person and have a
          create sense of humour which sounds about right. I think these will
          help me through my learning journey because I'm willing to help out
          people when they need it and hopefully they can help me if I ever get
          stuck. You get out what you put in. In terms of a great sense of
          humour, who doesn't like a laugh?

          My limitations are probably that I can get distracted easily, I find
          that sometimes at home working I can get a little distracted. I
          probably hangout with my cat a bit more than I should when I should be
          studying or working. I think this might be affect my journey as I can
          fall behind and rush things which would cause me to make mistakes.
          When I was at uni I did have this issue, i think though I can motivate
          myself more to do this rather than my degree.
        </li>

        <li>
          I mean there was always the dreaded group projects in uni that had
          some friction, a lot of people with a lot of different ideas that
          would clash. There was always someone who wanted it their way but
          couldn't. I felt like the best way around this was to get all the
          ideas and people would vote on what they wanted to do. This ruffled a
          few feathers but in the end we got a good group project with parts
          that everyone was proud of. Separating into sections was also very
          handy because people could do that one part their way, only problem
          with this is that the overall project would look strange as it wasn't
          the same across all parts. I think now I would try a pull away from
          the person or people that are trying to make it all about them and try
          bring it back to the overall team.
