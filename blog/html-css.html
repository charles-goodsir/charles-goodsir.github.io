    <p>
      <li>
        Classes are used for styling multiple elements while ids are usually
        used for styling a singular element on page
      </li>
      <li>
        its best to use classes for parts of the HTML that appear multiple times
        on a page like sections this helps not have repeats in the code
      </li>
      <li>
        You should use IDs but maybe not as much and only really for parts that
        are unique to your website overuse can make it harder to keep track in
        your CSS File
      </li>
      <li>
        It's best practice to use class for the styling rather than IDs cause in
        the long run it'll help you track down problems instead of looking
        through loads of IDs
      </li>
