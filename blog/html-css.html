    <p>
      <li>
        Classes are used for styling multiple elements while ids are usually
        used for styling a singular element on page.
      </li>
      <li>
        its best to use classes for parts of the HTML that appear multiple times
        on a page like sections this helps not have repeats in the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should use IDs but maybe not as much and only really for parts that
        are unique to your website overuse can make it harder to keep track in
        your CSS File.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's best practice to use class for the styling rather than IDs cause in
        the long run it'll help you track down problems instead of looking
        through loads of IDs.
      </li>

    <div>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/Diagram 1.jpeg"
          alt="Diagram 1"
          style="height: 350px; width: 350px"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we have an example of class and ID, I'm using the Content class to
        make all my pages look the same and act the same. In blue i have an ID
        as I want to make only one title on my main page a colour this is unique
        add so I need it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/Diagram 2.jpeg"
          alt="Diagram 2"
          style="height: 350px; width: 350px"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        In here we can see how I'm utilising the class and the ID, on my other
        pages I use the conntent class to line up the design but I only want the
        title on the first page to be blue so that uses the ID.
