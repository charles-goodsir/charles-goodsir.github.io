          My long term plan for my career is to move into a larger tech company
          and gain more experience in the tech world. My overall goal is to try
          make my way into Canva and start coding for them. I want to make an
          impact in a company and work on larger things than I am right now, I
          know this will take a long time to get larger projects but I want to
          put in that work.

          My strengths are that I always ask for help when I need it and that I
          am willing to help others when they need help as well. My weaknesses
          is probably my ability to plan things out properly, I'm very much a go
          with the flow kind of person and don't structure things as well as I
          should. This is something I am trying to get better at.
        </li>

        <li>
          I would like to get better at talking to people I don't know and learn
          more about them, I struggle sometimes to talk to new people and often
          get nervous in situations especially one on ones. This could also
          branch off into things like interviews which terrify me.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The way I have began managing my workflow is reading through the
          sprints and weeks work that I need to do during lunch or when I've
          finished work for the day. This gives me some idea on what I need to
          do. Using Toggl has been incredibly helpful and I have even started
          using it during work to be more productive. If things start getting to
          me I usually take a very long break and do something to get my body
          moving, like go for a walk or hit the gym to let the frustration out.
          I will always be respectful to my fellow classmates and the
          facilitators, it costs nothing to be a nice person.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I have never been someone who hasn't asked for help, if I ever get
          stuck or I am in a bad place I talk to someone. I am committed to what
          I am doing and it would be stupid not to ask for help when I need it.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I expect the facilitators to be there when we need it and lend a hand
          to everyone. To just be respectful is all I ask for. I know help will
          always be there but I don't expect baby sitters.
        </li>

          My block out times are 8:30am - 5pm Monday to Fridays. These are my
          work hours, our Sprints are every 2 weeks and my workload depends on
          our planning, if there is a slow Sprint I can work on school but a lot
          of my study will be after work.
