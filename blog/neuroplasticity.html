        <u> Neuroplasticity </u>
      </p>

        <li>
          Brain is consistently renewing itself and modifying connections,
          enhanced cognitive activity and increased capacity for healing
        </li>
        <li>
          It helps aid in my ability to learn and develop, it also is great for
          mental health as you're constantly improving
        </li>
        <li>
          Ways you can increases your neuroplasticity are things like brain
          games, rest, workouts, connecting with others socially

        <u>Growth Mindset</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Believing in ones growth through hard work, this is relevant because
          if you're in a fixed mindset how will you improve
        </li>
        <li>
          I feel like something changed in me as I saw that I was in fix mindset
          and needed to start looking more into how I can fix that
        </li>
        <li>
          To integrate the growth I need I will need to work hard to improve
          myself and work towards my goals. Setting goals for myself is a good
          way to know what I need to do in order to reach those.

        <u>Learning Plan</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          I think practicing coding and going that extra mile is the best way to
          get these things in your head.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having my goals as part on my learning strategy as well, this allows
          me to see where I want to go and what I need to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Looking into these more it seems clear on the learning style I want
          and the time I want to put into this because I want to succeed.
