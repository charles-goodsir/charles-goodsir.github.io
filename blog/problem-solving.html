        <u> Were Blocked on a Simple Problem: </u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          I got stuck on the manipulating objects assignment, i kept trying to
          write the code but nothing but failures were showing.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first thing I tried was re-reading the problem then applying what
          I thought the solution was. When that didn't work I talked the problem
          out loud to my cat to see if I could spark something, I had a few
          solutions that failed as well. I then turned to google which gave me
          the correct answer, I was close but was missing a few things.
        </li>
        <li>
          I felt frustrated during the process because I thought I was doing
          exactly what the instructions were saying but I was just a bit blind
          to what it was actually asking
        </li>
        <li>
          I mainly learnt that I need to take a little bit more time to read
          through it properly instead of jumping the gun
        </li>
      </p>

        <u>Elegantly Solved a Problem:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          I think trying to get those buzz words to disappear was the one I
          solved elegantly
        </li>
        <li>
          I talked out the problem I was having to my One Piece statue and then
          realised I missed the key element for the code to work properly whihc
          was the split function
        </li>
        <li>
          It was a bit of back and forth but once I got it right then i felt
          infintely better
        </li>
        <li>
          Talking the problem out loud is a good way of doing it even if you
          sound like an idiot
        </li>

          <td>
            This one I did a lot and is something I do at work, may as well try
            and be wrong then not try. It takes a solution off the table, this
            is good for when you ask for help because you can say you tried the
            solution if it comes up

        <tr>
          <td>Rubber Ducky Method</td>
          <td>
            I did this one a lot as well, I talked to my One Piece figurine and
            my cat and I found that speaking it outloud can be very helpful
            cause sometimes you miss something in the instructions.

        <tr>
          <td>Reading Error Messages</td>
          <td>
            I read a lot of the error messages and also put them into google or
            into ChatGPT to help me better understand them. I get a lot of
            errors at work and if you don't read them then you're defintely
            missing something.

        <tr>
          <td>Console.Logging</td>
          <td>
            I'm confident in this one but it's something that i haven't used
            before so it kind of fell to the bottom of the pile, I know i should
            use it more but i just kept forgetting.

        <tr>
          <td>Googling</td>
          <td>
            Probably the biggest gun in a coders arsenal is google, yeah I used
            it a lot and it can be very helpful if you ask the correct question.

            I think at this point in time since we're all new at this I didn't
            think to ask the rest of the class, my first choice would always be
            the coaches if I was stuck. As we go on though and our confidence
            rises then I'm sure knowledge sharing with each other will be very
            helpful

        <tr>
          <td>Asking coaches for help</td>
          <td>
            Probably one of the most helpful ones that I do is asking for help
            from the coaches, there are no stupid questions
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Improving with reflection</td>
          <td>
            I did reflect a few times on what I could do differently, I mean we
            learn the most from our failures

      <u> Reflect on a time when you didn't ask for help: </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      My first couple of weeks at my job I barely asked for help because I was
      embarressed that I didn't know anything, there were a lot of people with
      CS degrees and then there was me. I didn't want to be that person who
      didn't know anything or was annoying everyone with silly questions. Over
      time I realised that most of the people were in my position at some point,
      if i could do it again i would ask as many questions as I needed to
      because it would help me learn and grow confidence.
