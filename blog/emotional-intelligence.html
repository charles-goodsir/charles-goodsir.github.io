          Emotional Intellegince to me is knowing your own emotional capability
          and being able to see others. Being able to help a friend or someone
          through a tough time and empathise with them to me is a big part of
          EQ.

        <li>
          Working through the stress and tough times, strengthing your mind
          through excercises so that you can get through hard tasks that you
          thought you couldn't do.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Being able to work towards resolutions when there is split between the
          group and understanding both sides then trying to find a way for both
          parties to work together.
        </li>

          I feel like I have started trying to strengthen my mental habits by
          practicing meditation in the morning and clearing my mind. My mind is
          always so busy and having a few minutes to calm it down really helps.
