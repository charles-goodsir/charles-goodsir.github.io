            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </u>
        </p>
        <li>
          This was a very humbling experience, I thought that my years in tech
          would have provided me with the skills but I was wrong
        </li>
        <li>
          That you don't need to be scared to ask for help, there are no stupid
          questions
        </li>
        <li>Pushing our ego aside and working hard is the best thing to do</li>
        <p>
          <u>
            What's the deal with values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </u>
        </p>
        <li>
          Empathy in a team is like the grease of communication. It keeps people
          talking, sort of understanding each other, and sometimes even helping
          out. Plus, it’s great for smoothing out those team arugments or when
          people butt heads
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-awareness, I think that's your internal tech support. It’s what
          keeps you from totally losing it. It also gives you a little help when
          you mess up—like, “Hey, at least you learned something, right?”
        </li>
        <li>
          Values, man, values are like the nagging voice in your head that makes
          sure your code isn't a big bowl of dog doo doo. They’re the reason you
          write code that’s clean, runs smoothly, and doesn’t make future-you
          want to throw your laptop out the window.
        </li>
        <p>
          <u>
            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          </u>
        </p>
        <li>
          Learning more and more about my mind and people skills, there's lots
          of things that I thought probably weren't worth learning but I overall
          am glad I learned them.
        </li>

            >What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
            learning?</u
          >
        </p>
        <li>
          doing the one on ones, I think I'm always nervous talking to new
          people but it was very helpful getting to know all the other people
          and stepping out of my comfort zone.
        </li>
        <p>
          <u
            >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
            time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?</u
          >
        </p>
        <li>
          Because people skills are the best thing to have, you can be the
          smartest person in the room but if your a complete ass then no one is
          going to want to be around you. It's the same in the office
          environment. No one wants to work with a toxic smart ass who things
          they're the best.
        </li>
        <p>
          <u
            >Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</u
          >
        </p>
        <li>
          I don't think so at all, as someone with anxiety learning about this
          kind of thing is very helpful as it can help me nail things such as
          interviews and public speaking. Human skills will always be something
          that I want to improve more on
